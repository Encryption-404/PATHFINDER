This repository is designed for a drone project that employs SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms to enable autonomous mapping and navigation in various environments. The system runs on ROS Noetic, the final release of ROS 1, known for its robustness and extensive community support. By utilizing SLAM, the drone can construct a real-time map of its surroundings while determining its location within the map, enabling precise and efficient autonomous operation.

Now for the  LDROBOT D500 (LD19 or LD500) lidar is an affordable, lightweight 2D lidar suitable for applications like SLAM, navigation, and obstacle detection. It features a 360Â° scanning range, high-speed data acquisition (up to 12,000 points/sec), and good accuracy for mapping and localization. Its compact design makes it ideal for small robotics projects, and it is compatible with ROS, allowing integration with SLAM algorithms like Cartographer and Hector SLAM. Additionally, its USB communication makes it easy to set up with devices like the Raspberry Pi.
